Below is the project alignment blueprint: how CivicSense should be engineered and pitched to maximize scores on each criterion.

1) Problem & Solution Fit

What judges evaluate:

Is this a real problem?

Is the solution directly addressing it?

Is the logic coherent and grounded?

How your project must satisfy this
Real-world problem articulation

You must clearly show:

Municipal complaints today:

arrive in large volume

manually sorted

low prioritization accuracy

duplicate noise

safety risks ignored

This is the operational gap.

Direct solution mapping
Problem	CivicSense Feature
Manual sorting	NLP auto-classification
No prioritization	urgency scoring engine
Wrong routing	rule-based department dispatch
Duplicate complaints	semantic clustering
Slow response	priority dashboard

If judges see problem → feature mapping, you score high.

2) Innovation & Creativity

What judges evaluate:

Is this just another complaint portal?

Or does it introduce a new approach?

Your innovation is NOT:

submission form

dashboard UI

Your innovation IS:
AI triage engine

You must position the system as:

“An intelligence layer on top of civic grievance systems.”

Key innovative pieces:

1) Urgency scoring

Not FIFO — severity-based.

2) Duplicate clustering

Detecting 50 reports of same pothole.

3) AI routing

System decides department automatically.

4) Decision dashboard

Not reporting — operational triage.

This is where originality lies.

3) Technology Depth

What judges evaluate:

Is this technically difficult?

Did the team use meaningful AI/engineering?

Is this beyond CRUD apps?

Your system must visibly include:

A) NLP Classification

Transformers-based tagging.

B) Semantic Similarity

Embeddings + cosine similarity.

C) Urgency Modeling

Keyword + sentiment hybrid.

D) Pipeline Automation
input → ML → routing → dashboard


If ML runs live during demo → high score.

What NOT to do

Avoid fake AI:

manual dropdown categories

rule-only classification

static dashboards

Judges notice this immediately.

4) Impact & Practicality

What judges evaluate:

Can this work in real cities?

Is it deployable?

Does it scale?

You must show practicality:
Municipal department mapping

You already locked 6:

Sanitation

Roads

Water

Electricity

Safety

Traffic

This shows real deployment viability.

Scalability narrative

Explain:

plug into existing portals

API-based integration

works city-by-city

reduces manual triage load

Measurable impact claims

You must state:

triage time reduced

duplicate complaints consolidated

faster safety escalation

workload distribution clarity

Judges want measurable change.

The MOST IMPORTANT SHIFT

You are not building:

“Complaint management system”

You are building:

“AI-powered municipal decision support engine.”

This positioning alone increases scores across all 4 criteria.

Feature Prioritization Based on Judging

Now the build order changes.

Tier 1 — Mandatory (score drivers)

NLP classification

Urgency scoring

Routing automation

Priority dashboard

Tier 2 — High scoring

Duplicate clustering

Voice input

Tier 3 — Optional

Image detection

analytics trends

Demo Strategy Mapped to Criteria
Demo Flow

Citizen submits:

“There is an exposed electric wire near school”

System:

NLP → Electricity

urgency → HIGH

routing → Electricity Dept

duplicate → 7 similar reports

dashboard → top alert

Now you hit all criteria:

problem fit

innovation

tech depth

impact

Evaluation-Optimized Architecture
Citizen Input
   ↓
AI Triage Engine
   ↓
Priority + Routing
   ↓
Municipal Dashboard


Everything must revolve around this.

What judges will ask (prepare answers)
Q1: Why is this better than existing portals?

Answer: prioritization + automation.

Q2: Where is the AI?

Answer: classification, urgency, duplicates.

Q3: Can cities use this?

Answer: department mapping + scalable API.

Q4: What happens if scaled?

Answer: resource allocation improvement.

Final Instruction for Team

From now:

Every feature must pass this test:

Does this increase score in one of the four criteria?

If not → drop it.

Next step (critical)

Now that evaluation criteria are clear, we move to:

“Implementation blueprint aligned with judging”

This will include:

exact ML model choice

exact libraries

folder structure

API payloads

DB SQL schema

team task division

48-hour execution plan tied to scoring
